Pandas to read, clean and transform data
Matplotlib and seabourn for visualization.
In Python, instead of traditional excel and tableau, you don’t really get a visual reference. It is more useful for large datasets, mainly from databases.
Knowing Python and SQL, get’s you better salaries, more money and it will be worth it. There’s no cap. You can be a senior data analyst or scientist within a short period of time, and 
make lots of money. It’s hard but so it is another job, and you’ll be earning three or four times by the end of your second year. 

Sales.info() -> gets you the dataset information.
Sales.shape() -> gets you (rows, columns) total.
Sales.describe() -> gets you the most useful stats for the dataset. It is a QUICK way to review stats.
	If we want to do it just for one column, lets do Sales[“Unit_Cost”].describe()
	Plot: ax = Sales[“Unit_Cost”].plot(kind=”box”, vert =False, figsize=(14,6)) #This uses matplotlib,through pandas
	Could be another type of plot, like density: kind=”density”
	To make a line, use ax.axvline(sales[“Unit_cost”].mean(), color=”red”)
For histogram use kind=”hist”, ax.set_y_label(“y”), ax.set_x_label(“x”)
Count with .value_counts(), quick chart with .value_counts().plot(kind=….)
figsize gives the size of the plot, very useful.
Corr = sales.corr() gives you the correlation between columns. Example price and revenue.
For scatter plot, kind=”scatter”, x = adasd y = sadasdas
To group by, use Sales[[“profit”,”age_group”]].boxplot(by= “age_group”)
Try making subplots with subplot=True
Let’s add a new column to the dataset with sales[revenue_per_age] = sales[“revenue”] / sales[“age”]
Plot it with kind=”hist”, or whatever.
To check matches or unmatches: (sales[“Calculated_cost”] != sales[“Cost”]).sum()
Add 3% to everything (inflation): sales[“unit_price”] *= 1.03

Get sales from something: sales.loc[sales[“state”] == “Kentucky”] REMEMBER .loc uses [] not ()
If we want to get only one column, sales.loc[sales[”Age_group”] == “Youth <25”, “revenue”] gets revenue for the matches.
sales.loc[sales[”Age_group”] == “Youth <25”, “revenue”] *= 1.1 to increase all the matches.
For histograms, bins are the amount of cells or values taken into consideration by the plot.

sqlite3 for MySQL in python

conn = sqlite3.connect('data/sakila.db') for connecting with db
df = pd.read_sql(''' Query ''', conn, index_col = rental_id, parse_dates=['rental_date','return_date']) to get the dataset in a variable
* index_col= the name that the id will acquire
* parse_dates will will attempt to infer the format of the datetime

so we already have a dataframe! process is the same. For reviewing, use .head()
